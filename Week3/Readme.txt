Selected solutions for Lab3-assignments.

1) We've chosen the shortest solutions from the team for the implementation of the new functions.
   And we've added properties to check the correctness of the implementation.

2) All generators are very similar, we've chosen the solution that has documentation and the testing report is extended.

3) CNF convertor, we've chosen the smartest solution, and extended the testable properties.

4) We've merged the relevant properties

5) We've taken the best forumla generator, and implemented the new convertors. 
   We had one obvious property which we used the implementation of exercise 2 to test.
