{- Report:
	To automate the test, I considered a range of [-10..10]. I implemented each of the properties described in the question.
	I took out redundant properties. I ended up with 4 different properties.
	
	I adjusted the comparison functions from lecture2.hs to be compatible with the definition of my properties.
	And at the end I implemented a list of properties and passed it to a customized quick-sort function. The sorting method is based on the strength of properties when applied to all values in the given range [-10..10].
	
	My random list of properties is as follows:
													[prop0, prop1, prop2, prop3] [0,3,1,2]
	
	*Exercise3> strengthList
	[0,3,1,2]
	
	The sorted list of properties was returned as follows:
													[prop0, prop3, prop1, prop2] [0,3,1,2]
	
	The list is sorted from stongest to weakest condition.
